## What is this?

`marchat` is a minimalist terminal-based group chat app designed for real-time, distraction-free conversations. Whether you're pair programming, self-hosting a LAN party, or just chatting from two terminals, it's lightweight, hackable, and built for fun.

## Why Marchat?

Built for father-son coding sessions, marchat is about sharing the joy of hacking, learning, and chatting in a terminal. It's a fun, retro-inspired project for anyone who loves the command line, real-time collaboration, or just wants a simple, self-hosted chat.

## Features

- **Terminal UI (TUI):** Beautiful, scrollable chat using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- **Real-time WebSocket Chat:** Fast, robust, and cross-platform server/client
- **Themes:** Choose from `patriot`, `retro`, or `modern` for a unique look
- **Small File Sharing (<1MB):** Instantly send and receive small files with `:sendfile <path>` and save them with `:savefile <filename>`
- **Emoji Support:** Auto-converts common ASCII emoji (e.g., `:)`, `:(`, `:D`, `<3`, `:P`) to Unicode
- **Live User List:** See whoâ€™s online in a fixed-width, styled panel (up to 20 users shown)
- **@Mention Highlighting:** Messages with `@username` highlight for all users in the chat
- **Admin Mode:** Privileged commands (like `:cleardb`) for authenticated admins only
- **Message Cap:**
  - Only the last 100 messages are kept in memory for client performance
  - The server database automatically caps messages at 1000; oldest messages are deleted to make room for new ones
- **Configurable:** Set username, server URL, and theme via config file or flags
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Clean exit and robust connection handling (ping/pong heartbeat)
- **ASCII Art Banner:** Server displays a beautiful banner with connection info on startup

## Prerequisites

- Install [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/) if you havenâ€™t already
  - *(Check with `go version` in your terminal)*
- (Optional, for remote access) Download [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/) (`cloudflared.exe` on Windows)

## Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure marchat via flags or a `config.json`. Flags override config file values.

### 1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/marchat.git
cd marchat
```

### 2. Install Go dependencies
```sh
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Build the project
```sh
go build ./...
```

### 4. Run the server (port 9090, WebSocket)
```sh
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

> [!TIP]
> Customize admin settings with `--admin-username` and `--admin-key` for secure privileged access:
```sh
go run cmd/server/main.go --admin-username YourName --admin-key your-admin-key
```

### 5. (Optional) Create a config file
Create `config.json` in the project root:
```json
{
  "username": "Cody",
  "server_url": "ws://localhost:9090/ws",
  "theme": "patriot",
  "twenty_four_hour": true
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If no `config.json` is found, the client uses default values. Specify a custom config path with `--config`.

### 6. Run the client
```sh
# With flags:
go run client/main.go --username Cody --theme patriot --server ws://localhost:9090/ws

# Or with config file:
go run client/main.go --config config.json
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the server URL uses `ws://` for local development or `wss://` for production (secure WebSocket).

---

## Remote Access (Optional)

If you want to make your marchat server accessible from outside your local network (e.g., to chat with friends remotely), use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/).

### 1. Download cloudflared
- [Get cloudflared for your OS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/)

### 2. Start a tunnel to your local server
```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:9090
```

> [!TIP]
> Cloudflare provides a public `https://` URL. Convert it to `wss://.../ws` for the client (e.g., `https://bold-forest-cat.trycloudflare.com` becomes `wss://bold-forest-cat.trycloudflare.com/ws`).

### 3. Update your client config
```sh
go run client/main.go --username Cody --admin --admin-key your-admin-key --server wss://bold-forest-cat.trycloudflare.com/ws
```

> [!NOTE]
> Temporary tunnels donâ€™t require a Cloudflare account. For persistent tunnels, see the [Cloudflare Tunnel docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/).

## Usage

Interact with marchat using the following commands and features:

- **Send messages**: Type and press `Enter`.
- **File sharing**:
  - Send files (<1MB): `:sendfile <path>`
  - Save received files: `:savefile <filename>`
- **Emoji support**: Auto-converts ASCII emoticons to Unicode (`:)`, `:(`, `:D`, `<3`, `:P`).
- **Mentions**: Use `@username` to highlight a user (full message highlighted).
- **Scroll**: Use Up/Down arrows or mouse to navigate chat history.
- **Commands**:
  - `:theme <name>`: Switch theme (`patriot`, `retro`, `modern`; persists in config).
  - `:time`: Toggle 12/24-hour timestamp format (persists in config).
  - `:clear`: Clear local chat buffer (client-side only, does not affect others).
  - `:cleardb`: Wipe entire server database (admin only).
- **User list**: Displays up to 20 online users, with a styled `+N more` indicator for additional users.
- **ASCII art banner**: Shows connection info on server startup (disable via config or flag).
- **Quit**: Press `Ctrl+C` or `Esc` to exit.

> [!CAUTION]
> The `:cleardb` command permanently deletes all messages in the server database. Use with caution, as this action cannot be undone.

> [!NOTE]
> File transfers are limited to 1MB to ensure performance. Larger files should be shared via other methods.

Modular architecture: client, server logic, and shared types are separated for clarity and maintainability.

## Admin Mode: Privileged Commands & Security

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Admin commands like `:cleardb` require the `--admin` flag and a matching `--admin-key`. Only users listed as admins on the server can authenticate.

- **Start server with admins**:
  ```sh
  go run cmd/server/main.go --admin Cody --admin Crystal --admin-key your-admin-key
  ```
- **Connect as admin**:
  ```sh
  go run client/main.go --username Cody --admin --admin-key your-admin-key --server wss://localhost:9090/ws
  ```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use the default admin key (`changeme`) in production. Change it immediately to prevent unauthorized access.

- Admin usernames are case-insensitive.
- The admin key is sent only during the WebSocket handshake.
- All admin actions use WebSocket (no HTTP endpoints).

---

## Security

> [!WARNING]
> For production deployments:
> - Change the default admin key (`changeme`) to a secure value.
> - Use `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections.
> - Ensure firewall rules allow your chosen port (default: 9090).
> - Consider a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) for added security.

## Tech Stack
- [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.24+
- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (TUI)
- [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) (styling)
- [modernc.org/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite) (pure Go SQLite, no C compiler required)
- [Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) (real-time messaging)

**Platform Support**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows terminals supporting ANSI escape sequences.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Panic: `close of closed channel`**
  - Fixed: The client now guards against double-close of internal channels.
- **Client fails to connect with `http://` URL**
  - Use a WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:9090/ws` or `wss://...` for remote.
- **Mentions not highlighted**
  - Use `@username` exactly (word boundary, not substring).
- **User list not updating**
  - Ensure server and client are both up to date and using compatible protocols.
- **Messages not showing or chat not updating**
  - Check your WebSocket connection and server logs for errors.
- **Old messages missing from chat history**
  - The server database only keeps the most recent 1000 messages.
- **Too many users in user list**
  - Only up to 20 users are shown, with a styled `+N more` indicator.
- **Firewall/Port**: Ensure port 9090 is open for remote connections.
- **Admin commands**
  - Ensure `--admin` and `--admin-key` match server settings.
