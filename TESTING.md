## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD environments:

- **Fast Execution**: Most tests complete in under 1 second
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Go standard library and SQLite
- **Parallel Safe**: Tests can run concurrently
- **Deterministic**: No flaky tests or race conditions

## Adding New Tests

### Guidelines

1. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
2. **Test Structure**: Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
4. **Coverage**: Aim for meaningful coverage, not just line coverage
5. **Documentation**: Add comments for complex test scenarios

### Example Test Structure

```go
func TestFeatureName(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    setup := createTestSetup()
    input := createTestInput()
    
    // Act
    result, err := functionUnderTest(input)
    
    // Assert
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("Unexpected error: %v", err)
    }
    
    if result != expectedResult {
        t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expectedResult, result)
    }
}
```

### Database Test Pattern

```go
func TestDatabaseOperation(t *testing.T) {
    // Create test database
    db, err := sql.Open("sqlite", ":memory:")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("Failed to open test database: %v", err)
    }
    defer db.Close()
    
    // Create schema
    CreateSchema(db)
    
    // Test the operation
    // ... test implementation
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **In-Memory Databases**: Tests use SQLite in-memory mode for speed
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests are designed to run in parallel when possible
- **Minimal Setup**: Each test creates only the data it needs
- **Fast Cleanup**: Tests clean up resources immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are properly imported
2. **Database Locks**: Tests use separate in-memory databases to avoid conflicts
3. **Race Conditions**: All concurrent tests use proper synchronization
4. **Memory Leaks**: Tests properly close database connections and channels
5. **PowerShell Execution Policy**: May need to enable script execution: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
6. **Coverage Tool Syntax**: Use `go tool cover -func coverage.out` (without equals sign)

### Debug Mode

Run tests with debug output:

```bash
# Enable Go test debugging
go test -v -race ./...
```

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to Marchat:

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow TDD principles where possible
2. **Update This Document**: Add new test categories and coverage areas
3. **Maintain Coverage**: Ensure new code is properly tested
4. **Run Full Suite**: Always run all tests before submitting changes

## Test Metrics

- **Total Tests**: 366 individual test cases across 11 packages
- **Coverage by Package**: 83.1% (plugin/license), 82.4% (shared), 78.6% (config), 76.5% (client/crypto), 55.2% (client/config), 46.8% (plugin/store), 42.2% (cmd/license), 35.4% (server), 27.8% (client), 22.3% (plugin/host), 12.4% (plugin/manager), 5.6% (cmd/server)
- **Overall Coverage**: 37.1% across all packages
- **Execution Time**: <3 seconds for full suite
- **Reliability**: 100% deterministic, no flaky tests, no hanging tests
- **Test Files**: 26 test files covering core functionality, client components, plugin system, server operations, and admin interfaces

This foundational test suite provides a solid base for testing core functionality, with room for significant expansion in the main application components.
